                    <p>Greetings, I'm Sandeep, an enthusiastic student specializing in electrical machine design, finite element analysis, and control systems. Currently, I'm immersed in my postgraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/?view=featured">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where my focus lies in the development and control of electromagnetic actuators tailored for aerospace applications.

                        My journey into this fascinating field commenced with a Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.vssut.ac.in/">Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology</a>, Burla. For my undergraduate project, I delved deeply into the modeling and control of bidirectional DC-DC converters. My work involved crafting a comprehensive state-space model for the converter, alongside devising a control logic facilitating seamless grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid operations.
                        
                        Throughout my academic pursuits, I've garnered extensive expertise in various domains, including the design of electromagnetic products such as rotating machines and brakes. Moreover, my proficiency in finite element analysis has enabled me to conduct intricate electromagnetic analyses, enriching my understanding of complex systems.
                        
                        In terms of programming proficiency, I am adept in MATLAB, leveraging its power to conduct dynamic studies and develop precise mathematical models. Additionally, I possess foundational skills in C++, which have proven invaluable in my academic endeavors.
                        
                        My commitment to advancing knowledge in my field is underscored by my contributions to scientific literature. I've had the privilege of publishing several research articles in esteemed journals, showcasing my ability to conduct rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the scientific community.
                        
                        Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my research journey, pushing the boundaries of electromagnetic product development and making substantive contributions to the field.
